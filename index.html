            <img src="./assets/images/wendy.jpeg" alt="Profile picture of Wendy" class="image1">
                <p>My name is Wendy Vu! I am currently 22 and my favorite hobbies
                    include traveling, eating and watching Korean Dramas! I graduated 
                    with a Psychology Degree at the University of Washington but is currently
                    enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at the same University to truly pursue my interests! 
                    I graduated UW Cum Laude, and was regularly on the Quarterly Dean's List. 
                    I am a bit nervous but a whole lot excited to see what the world of 
                    tech has in store for me.

                <p >This is my fiance, Dakota! We met in middle school but only started dating
                    during Junior Year of High School. We have been together for more than five years and 
                    will be getting married in July 2023. We currently moved out to our very first 
                    place together and have been having a lot of fun cooking, playing games, and watching
                    TV together!

                <p> Last but not least, this is the newest addition to my family.
                    Her name is Yuki, and she is a pure-bred Pembroke Corgi! We got Yuki at the beginning of 2021, 
                    and ever since she has been my proudest accomplishment. Yuki is super smart and 
                    knows at least over 30 tricks, but of course, will be hesitant to do them unless treats
                    are invovled. She is my absolute favorite being the in the whole universe ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥°.

                <p>This is my very first project coding, and I got to work with mainly HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
                    I was introduced to a whole new world called GitHub and the functionality behind it blew my mind. 
                    This website that I eventually created through numerous trial and errors, serve as a library for notes 
                    that were taken during the Prework portion of the bootcamp!

                <p id="work2p">This is my second project with coding. In this project, I was given a base
                    code to look over to concise everything but also make sure that the functionality of
                    it doesn't changes. During this project, I mainly worked with CSS and HTML, looking over
                    shortcuts to simplify repetitve elements and also as an exercise to read and understand these languages.
