# Wendy-Meets-World
This is my portfolio which will be updated as I work through the UW Bootcamp course. 

Description

The objective of this project was to create a website that contains information about me and also my work: a portfolio. The goal of this website is to introduce myself and also serve as a space where I can store projects that I have worked on in order to showcase it to others. This website was made during the second week of the bootcamp during the time where we are getting comfortable with HTML as well as CSS which was also my focus to familiarize with through this project. 

This is the link to the website: https://chewytaro.github.io/Wendy-Meets-World/

Usage

This website holds information about myself as well as my works and how to reach me. The first part of the website will be an "About Me" section where I introduce myself as well as my lifestyle. Next portion of the page will be for the works that I've done while learning how to code. This space will be continuously updated as I continue the bootcamp and have more works to add. Images in this section are clickable meaning that if you click on the picture, it will be linked to the page that the picture is from. The last section is a how to contact me section with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn and also my email information.
